# Last week

## Overview of lecture 2

Looked at data analysis.

# This week 

## Hypothesising 

Research science is about coming up with hypotheses and evaluating them.

::: {.notes}
This lecture thinking about posing and answering reserach questions. 

I have this great idea - considering the data is this idea plausibly true?
:::

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lecture you should:

1. Establish a hypothesis.
2. Define the Type I and Type II errors. -	Define the Type I and Type II errors. 
3. Calculate the p-value.

# Motivations

## How do we know what to believe?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**What we see in the news**

- Is London less safe for cyclists than ten years ago?
- Are x days above 30 degrees in London indicative of a warming climate? 
- Is London‚Äôs murder rate higher than New York? 

:::

# How do you come up with a hypothesis? 

## What is a hypothesis?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}
- You have a coin. 
- You think it's a fair coin. 
- You toss it 10 times. 
- It comes up heads 7 times. 
:::

:::

::::


## What question can you ask?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- You have a coin. 
- You think it's a fair coin. 
- You toss it 10 times. 
- It comes up heads 7 times. 

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Is it a fair coin? **NO!** 
- What‚Äôs the probability that it‚Äôs fair? **NO!**
- If the coin is fair, how likely would it be to see 7 heads out of 10 flips? **ALMOST!**

## What question should you ask?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- You have a coin. 
- You think it's a fair coin. 
- You toss it 10 times. 
- It comes up heads 7 times. 

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Correct formulation:** 

If the coin is fair, how likely would it be to see 7 heads out of 10 flips *OR AN EVEN MORE EXTREME RESULT?*

# Establishing a Hypothesis 

## Step 1
**Define the question**

Null hypothesis ‚Äì the status quo. 
The alternative hypothesis ‚Äì need some evidence to verify. 

## Step 2
**Set you significance level**

- Decide what ‚Äútoo unlikely‚Äù means BEFORE YOU DO THE TEST.
- e.g. ùú∂ = 0.05 (5% significance)
- This means that if we see evidence that would have less than a 5% chance of occurring if the null hypothesis is true, then we reject the null hypothesis. 

## Step 3
**Identify the evidence**

- Example: data collection ‚Äì i.e urine sample for pregnancy test 

## Step 4
**Calculate the p-value**

- The p-value is the probability of seeing the evidence, or something even more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true.

## Step 5 
**Compare p-value with hypothesis level**

- p-value > ùú∂ - Evidence not that unlikely. Not enough evidence to reject H0.
- p-value ‚©Ω ùú∂ - Evidence very unlikely. Reject H0 and accept H1.

## The steps
::: {.incremental}
1. Define the question
2. Set you significance level
3. Identify the evidence
4. Calculate the p-value
5. Compare p-value with hypothesis level
:::

## Example 
Cyclists in London. 

# Types of error 

## Type I error

## Type II error

## Example 

## Matrix of errors 

# A good hypothesis or a bad hypothesis? 
What makes a hypothesis good? 

## Understanding the literature and the context 
Hypothesis doesn‚Äôt come out of thin air

## Asking ethical hypothesis questions 
- not making unethical assumptions in choosing the hypothesis. 
- Example: correlation between ethnicity and crime
- Use contextual knowledge to consider correlation vs causation 

## Correlation vs. Causation 
Lots of things can be correlated - but it doesn't mean one event caused another. 

## Aliens and taxes 
Example from spurious correlations 

## Correlation IS NOT causation 
You might not know whether events are correlated, or causing each other. 

The point of the hypothesis test is to test your idea ‚Äì but use your contextual understanding to come up with plausible (and ethical) initial questions

## The point of the scientific method
The process of coming up with a question, testing, iterating.

# Statistical tests 

## Parametric vs. Non-parametric tests

## Parametric Tests 
- Evaluate hypothesis for specific parameters 
- Typically have assumptions about the distribution - e.g. assumed normal distribution 

## Non-parametric Tests 
- Evaluate hypotheis for entire population distirbution 
- Typcially less assumptions on the ditribution 

## How many tails 

Tests can be one-tailed or two-tailed. 

![](l3_img/one-tailed-vs-two-tailed-test.jpg){.absolute top="170" left="30" width="700"}

# Parametric tests 

## T-test 
Assumes the data is normally distributed. 

## T-test example 

What is the probability of someone age 15 being a student on CASA007? 

The probability is very small so we reject. 

## Regression T-tests

Is the gradient non-zero?

This indicates a correlation between the two variables. 

...

This will be covered further in lecture X on linear regression. 

## Mean comparison t-test 

Compares the mean of two distributions. 

# Non-parametric tests 

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 
::: {.incremental}
- Compares two probability distributions 
- Can be used to test whether an observed sameple came from a given distribution 
- Or to test whether two samples both came from the same distribution
:::

## Kernel density estimate 
::: {.incremental}
- Used to generate a smooth PDF for a random variable dataset. 
- Think of it as getting a smooth function to describe a histogram of data. 
- There are no assumptions about the prior distribution
:::

# Overview 
We've covered: 

- What makes a good hypothesis 
- How to formally state a hypothesis 
- Types of statistical tests 


# Practical 
Practical will focus on establishing a evaluation a hypothesis. 

- Have questions prepared!
