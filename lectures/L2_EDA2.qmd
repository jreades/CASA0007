# Last week

## Overview of lecture 1

Looked at data analysis. Different types of data. 

# This week 

## First things first

Exploratory data analysis is the first step of any data science project 

::: {.notes}
link to scientific process and how we iterate over ideas and concepts 
:::

## Introducing statistical concepts 

This lecture looking at statistical concepts. 

Data science is about using ideas from statistics to describe large datasets 

Here looking to describe numerical data – focus on probability distributions. 


## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lecture you should:

1. Evaluate whether a dataset is representative. 
2. Define the probability density function. 
3. Identify common probability distributions. 

# Motivation 

## What is the likelihood of events occuring? 
::: {.incremental}
- What is the probability of someone in this lecture theatre being over 6ft?
- Need to first understand the distribution of heights. 
:::

::: {.notes}
This week thinking about the distribution of data. 

Next week, thinking about formulating and answering the research question. 
:::

# Random Sampling 

## The dream vs reality 
Ideally, we would like all the relevant data – but in reality normally have a subset 

::: {.notes}
It would be great if I knew the height of every adult in the UK, but unrealistic to collect – however maybe I could collect all adults at UCL. 
:::

## Approximating 
Expect what happens in the sample to approximate what happens in the whole population. 

# Is the data representative? 

## Bias

It's important to understand if your dataset truly representative or is it susceptible to bias? 

## Cognitive bias 

[*Systematic patterns in how we think about, and perceive, the world.*]{style="color:#49a0c4"} 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

We all have cognitive biases. 

These can impact our research, in particular dataset collection, selection and processing.

:::

::::

## Why is this important? 

If we're not careful we can propagate bias to the reserach, and hence results. 

This can lead to incorrect conclusions. 

## Types of bias 

Examples of dataset bias include historical bias and selection bias.

## Historical bias
[*Reflects existing, real world, inequalities*]{style="color:#49a0c4"} 

Examples: 

- [Police profiling](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/uk-police-forces-supercharging-racism-crime-predicting-tech-new-report) 
- [Hungry judges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_judge_effect)

## Selection bias 
[*When the sample chosen doesn’t represent the whole population of interest*]{style="color:#49a0c4"} 

This can be due to not having an adequately random sample. 

Example: 

- The health of people in hospital is worse than the general population. 

Or self-selection bias, where the people who contribute to the data exhibit specific attributes.  

Example:

- WEIRD study. 

## Can data ever be truly representative? 
Probably not. 

## Failing that 

- Acknowledge our biases!

# Normal Distribution 

## Everywhere you look

::: {.incremental}
- Human height
- Happiness
- Petal size
:::

## The distribution we're all familiar with 

::: {.incremental}
- Symmetrical
- Single peak 
- Smooth tails on both sides
:::

## Uniquely described by two equations 

Mean: 
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
E[x]
\end{align}
```

Standard deviation: 
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
E[x]
\end{align}
```

## and a probability distribution function
[*Probability density function (PDF) describes the likelihood of different outcomes for a random variable*]{style="color:#49a0c4"} 

The PDF of the normal distribution is: 
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
E[x]
\end{align}
```

## Key features 

::: {.incremental}
- Characteristic size (all data points close to the mean): symmetric and single peak
- Data is equally likely to be larger or smaller than average (symmetric): Smooth tails on both sides
- Data is continuous (it is something you measure not something you count) 
:::

## Sampling distributions 

Note importance of sampling distributions. 

In the case of the normal distribution: Std represented by σ vs std represented by σ/√n

## Example: distance to school 

## Not everything is normal 
Many real world datasets are *approximately* normally distributed.

But not all, things might not have a characteristic size, or not continuous, or not symmetric 

# More generally, what is a probability distribution? 

## Continous vs. Discrete 

## Back to the probability density function 
Why it’s useful – see next week, allows us to evaluate the probability of events, and hence evaluate hypotheses 

## Sampling distributions 
Specific for different probability distributions (/n)

## Skewed and long tails 
In reality, few things are actually normal.

# Binomial distribution 

## Coin toss 
- If I flip a coin 10 times, how often can I expect to get at least 7 heads? 
- Describes the frequency of successes in a test with 2 outcomes 

# Poisson distribution 

## Death by horse kicks 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}
- It's 1894. 
- You're the statistician Ladislaus Bortkiewicz.
- And you're wondering, 
- How many soldiers in the Prussian army have been killed by horse kicks?

## Measuring rare events

::: {.incremental}
- Imagine a situation where certain rare events (like arrival of mail) can occur in an **independent** fashion. 
- The Poisson distribution estimates how many such events are expected within a time interval
- Fixed interval (e.g. one minute)
- Fixed rate of events (λ) (e.g. 4 cars per minute, λ = 4)
-	Events occur independently.
-	Poisson Distribution gives the probability of k events.
:::

## Probability density function 

# Exponentials and Logarithms 

## Exponentials

If the Poisson measures the probability of x events within a time period, then the Exponential measures how long we are likely to wait between events.

## Estimating rabbit populations
Allows us to answer questions like: "how many rabbits at t=10?"

Answering questions like “Or when will the rabbit population=250?” 

This is easier said than done – the best way is to invert the equation – this requires 

. . . 

## Logarithms 
- It is an inverse operation. Multiply and divide are inverse operations of one another (they reverse the process) 

# Overview 
We've covered: 

- Representative data 
- Normal distribution
- Binomial distribution 
- Poisson distribution 
- Exponetials 
- Logarithms 


# Practical 
Practical will focus on plotting and generating sumamry statistics for data following a range of probability distributions.

Have questions prepared!
